# 🐍 CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python – Project Repository

This repository contains all the coursework, problem sets, and final project I completed as part of [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python), a course offered by Harvard University.

CS50P provided a solid introduction to programming using Python, covering concepts in computer science, data types, control flow, file I/O, regular expressions, testing, web APIs, and more.
